## Story

SuperheroRL is set in _Justice City_; a place of duality if there ever was one. You'll find the lowest of the low here, yet the civilians aren't afraid; for they know the _League of Justice_ will defend them.

## Gameplay

SuperheroRL is played like any other roguelike, with one gimmick; the player is a **superhero**. He does not collect gold or gear; he doesn't delve dungeons; and he doesn't fight monster (usually). Instead, the player roams the city (Justice City) and fights criminals and crooks (or innocent civilians, if he so chooses).

The main way for the player to advance is to gain Fame or Infamy. These are points gained by fighting people (villains and innocents respectively). With these points he gains access to more restricted areas of the city, like the _Mayor's Office_, the _Maffia Hideout_ or the _League of Justice HQ_.
